            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Our journey began with a simple goal: to create outerwear that
              combines functionality with fashion. We started with a small
              collection of classic designs, and thanks to the trust of our
              customers, we've grown into a go-to destination for stylish and
              versatile jackets
